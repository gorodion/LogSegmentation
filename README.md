# LogSegmentation
We have photos of timber trucks and we need to segment logs

Model, disparity maps & data: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18A9Aoew0tTzEYwugS-cCLKW3v1or7pyH?usp=sharing
data.zip - training data
segm_butts.pth - model's weights to segment group of butts
segm_butts_dotted.pth - model's weights to segment butts separately
logs_net.pth - model's weights to segment logs

## Instruction
1. Firstly specify PATH in config.py as path to model & disparity maps. Next:
2. Follow demo.ipynb
